Guidelines Followed
AI tools were used strictly as assistants for learning specific concepts and troubleshooting. All core application design, architecture, logic, and code implementation was done by our team.

Usage Log:-

October 14, 2025
AI Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose/Query: "How to structure a Dart class for a recipe with ingredients and steps?"
How It Was Used: Brainstormed different data modeling approaches. We then designed and implemented our own Recipe class based on our app's specific needs.
Learning Outcome: Understood best practices for creating complex data models in Dart.

October 16, 2025
AI Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose/Query: "How to check for pixel alignment and UI consistency issues in Flutter?"
How It Was Used: Used to understand Flutter's debugging tools for identifying layout and rendering issues in our recipe cards.
Learning Outcome: Learned to use Flutter Inspector and debug painting to fix UI alignment problems.

October 18, 2025
AI Tool: GitHub Copilot
Purpose/Query: In-line code suggestions while typing.
How It Was Used: Used for auto-completing repetitive code patterns (e.g., widget structures) after we started typing the initial logic.
Learning Outcome: Improved coding speed for boilerplate UI code, allowing us to focus on complex features.

October 20, 2025
AI Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose/Query: "What's the proper way to integrate OpenAI API in a Flutter app for recipe suggestions?"
How It Was Used: Researched API integration patterns to understand how to structure our AI service layer for future enhancements.
Learning Outcome: Learned about HTTP client setup, API authentication, and response handling in Flutter for AI features.

October 22, 2025
AI Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose/Query: "I'm getting a 'Null check operator used on a null value' error in my Flutter list. What are common causes?"
How It Was Used: Used to debug a specific runtime error by getting a list of potential causes to investigate.
Learning Outcome: Learned about null safety in Dart and how to properly handle potential null values in lists.

October 24, 2025
AI Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose/Query: "Best practices for implementing a grocery list aggregation algorithm in Dart"
How It Was Used: Researched efficient data structure approaches for our grocery list generation feature.
Learning Outcome: Learned about Map operations and data aggregation techniques for combining ingredients from multiple recipes.


The final codebase, architecture, and all creative solutions are the result of our team's own development work. AI served only to supplement our learning process and resolve specific, targeted challenges.
